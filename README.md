Following Colt Steele's class on Udemy. Looking for a modern refresher and putting my own spin on some of the projects like callbacks (node lecture114.js) and arrow functions (node lecture121.js).

#### If you are following the class, do the work yourself first before looking at these files. You are only cheating yourself, besides, I could have no idea what I am doing.

These are my working files for the class and some are probably better than others, based on how tired I was when I was doing them. I noticed Colt added some Git lessons at the end of the class so figured I would just start committing them now. All of the basic html/css/javascript files for the early portion of the class are in _public/section-html_. They are labeled with lectureXX.filetype. They are meant to run in the browser or with node. Many of the JavaScript files only have HTML files to load the JS into the console, so don't expect a whole lot from them in the window.
